# This Amazing Apple pie will Blow your mind.. trust me try it!!
# Its a simple homemade apple pie recipe which I have tried

# Ingredients for Our Ultimate Apple Pie:
# 2 pie crusts
# 6-7 Apples, peeled, cored  (7 cups thinly sliced)
# 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
# 8 Tbsp unsalted butter
# 3 Tbsp all-purpose flour
# 1/4 cup water
# 1 cup granulated sugar
# 1 egg + 1 Tbsp water = for egg wash

# First we will start by making the sauce of the apple pie and belive me this is our secret ingrideint 
# We will start by taking a Saucepan and add 8 tbs of unsalted butter and let it melt on medium flame
# Along with that we will add 3 tbs of all purpose flour with 1 cup of granulated sugar
# To that we will add 1/4 cup water add vigriously stir it untill it gets a caramel like consistency
# Now we will take it out of the flame and let our sauce cool while we prepare the apples
# Now we will slice 6-7 Apples and peel them before slicing them
# Remember to core the apples before slicing them (thinly slice them)
# After slicing them.. keep them in a large bowl and add 1 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon and spinkle them over the apples and coat them with cinnamon evenly
# After completing the above step.. pour our sauce on the cinnamon coated apples and give a sauce coat evenly to all the apples
# Now set our apples aside and now lets prepare our baking tin
# Now take your pie crust1 and roll it out then put it in the tin evenly spreading it
# Now add our coated apple and pour them onto our spread pie crust and shake the tin a little to even out the apples
# And now, grab second pie crust and roll it out flat and with the help of your pizza cutter, cut 10 equal strips of the dough
# And now lay out the strips in a weaving pattern on the top to avoid the pouring of apples and plus it make it look fancy
# And now tuck the excess pie crust into the tin
# Last but not the least.. prepare the Egg Wash (1 egg + 1 Tbsp water )
# Now using a patry brush, spread this eggwash generously all over the pie cruest and make sure that you only coat the pie crust and NOT the apples. Applying egg wash gives your crust a fine colour while its baking
# After that put this Apple Pie in a preheated oven and let it bake for 425F for 15 minutes 
# Then after 16 minutes are over, without opening the oven door, reduce the temperature to 350F for 45 minutes
# Once you are done baking, Take it off the oven and let it cool for about an hour
# And now you are ready to serve this tasty apple pie which going to make to say WOW!!
# THANK YOU!!
